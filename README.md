# Creating A React app for fulfillment  of FreeCodeCamp Certification

## Brief
This is a react app that I am creating to help me polish my skills in react as a developer.


## How It Works
The app is pretty simple it's fetching some quotes from the quotable api. The name of the author and the quote is grabbed from the response and is printed on the DOM.

### Why React is used then?
    React is used to easily manipulate the DOM. :)
    State is used to update the quotes easily.
    Effects are used to prevent the app from fetching again and again infinitely.

## Structure
A component is created for the quote the next button and tweet button is contained in the component.
author name and quote are feeded to the quote using the props. There was no need of creating a separate component of the quote as I am not using it again and again but I wanted to polish my skills of props and objects hence I followed this structure.
The App component contains a simple title bar and then the quote component.

### Thank You :)
